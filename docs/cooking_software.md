While using [grocy](https://grocy.info/) to manage my recipes I've found what
I want from a recipe manager:

* Write recipes in plaintext files.
* Import recipes from urls.
* Import other recipes in a recipe. To avoid code repetition. For example if
    I want to do raviolis carbonara, I want to have a basic recipe to create raviolis
    and another for carbonara, then a normal recipe that imports both.
* Define processes that can be imported as steps in recipes, for example boil
    water
* Change the number the servings
* Annotate lessons learned
* Translate common cooking units (spoonful, a piece) into metric system units of
    volume and weight.
* Helper to follow the recipe while cooking
* Keep track of the evolution of the recipe each time you cook it with
    deviations from plan, evaluation of the result dish, lessons learned and
    changes made to the recipe.
* Attach image to the recipe
* Specify the storage size (a ration of lentils uses 2cm of a tupper).
* Give rating to recipes
* Track the number of times you do a recipe
* Grade the maturity level of a recipe by the number of times done and the
    number of changes.
* Browse all available recipes with the possibility of:
    * Search by name
    * Search by ingredient
    * Filter by season
    * Filter by meal type (lunch, dinner, dessert...)
    * Sort by rating
    * Sort by number of times cooked
    * Sort by last time cooked
    * Show never cooked recipes
* Do a meal plan
* Create reusable meal plans
* Be able to talk to the inventory management tool to:
    * See if there are enough ingredients.
    * Fill up the shopping list.
* Select which recipes I want to cook this month, the program should show me the
    available ones taking into account the season.
* Keep track of the season of the ingredients, so you can mark an ingredient as
    in season or out of season, and that will allow you to select which recipes
    to add, or tell you which recipes are no longer going to be available.
* Define variations of a recipe, imagine that instead of red pepper you have
    green
* Be able to tell the brand of an ingredient
* Define the cooking tools to use, which will be shown when preparing a recipe
* Define the preparing and clean steps of a cooking tool.
* Show the number of inactivity interruptions, their time and the total amount
    of inactive time.
* Calculate the recipe time from the times of the processes involved and
    subsequent recipes
* Be able to define where each process is carried out, what is the distance
    between the places
* Suggest optimizations in the cooking process:
    * Reorder of steps to reduce waiting time and movement
* Be able to start from the basic features and incrementally add on it
